7.7.0 / 2016-03-25
==================

  * v7.7.0
  * Merge pull request [#514](https://github.com/node-nock/nock/issues/514) from kevinburkeshyp/fix-req-no-match
    Fix nock.emitter.on('no match') undefined argument
  * Merge pull request [#512](https://github.com/node-nock/nock/issues/512) from kevinburkeshyp/fix-typo
    Fix typo in tests
  * browserify bundle update
  * request abort destroys socket. fixes [#511](https://github.com/node-nock/nock/issues/511)
  * Fix nock.emitter.on('no match') undefined argument
    Previously if you disabled net connect via `nock.disableNetConnect`,
    `nock.emitter.on('no match')` would return undefined for its first argument,
    since `req` is never initialized. Replaces `req` with `options`, which is
    present and set to a Url instance.
    Fixes the global nock.emitter.on event listener to remove all event listeners
    at the end of each test, otherwise an event listener registered in one test
    might bleed over into the next.
    (This might not be the right fix, I'm happy to change as necessary).
  * Fix typo in tests
